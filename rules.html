                            Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend
                            to
                            the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                            leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                            required to play all their games away.</li>
